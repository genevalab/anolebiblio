# Anolis literature collection
This respository hosts an ever improving bibliography of literature relating to _Anolis_ lizards. This file is then used to create the [Anole Literature](http://www.anoleannals.org/anole-literature/anole-bibliography/) page on [Anole Annals](http://www.anoleannals.org). If you have citations to add, we encourage these be submitted as a pull request.

The collection is saved as a [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org) file, a format used by the Latex markup language. Free software like [Bibdesk](http://www.bibdesk.org), [JabRef](http://www.jabref.org/), and [BibTool](http://www.gerd-neugebauer.de/software/TeX/BibTool/en/) can be used to open BibTex files directly and most major citation software packages (e.g. Endnote, Papers, Mendely, Zotero) can import BibTeX files.
